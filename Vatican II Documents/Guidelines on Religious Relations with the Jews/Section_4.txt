IV. Joint Social Action
Jewish and Christian tradition, founded on the Word of God, is aware of the value of the human person, the image of God. Love of the same God must show itself in effective action for the good of mankind.

In the spirit of the prophets, Jews and Christians will work willingly together, seeking social justice and peace at every level - local, national and international.

At the same time, such collaboration can do much to foster mutual understanding and esteem.
