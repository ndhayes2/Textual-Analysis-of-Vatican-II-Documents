The Second Vatican Council was convened by Pope John XXIII and formally summoned through the apostolic constitution Humanae Salutis on 25 December 1961. The opening session took place in St. Peter's Basilica on 11 October 1962, under the presidency of Pope John XXIII, who was succeeded by Pope Paul VI after his death in June 1963.

The council's purpose was to address relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the modern world. It aimed to renew church doctrines and practices in the context of contemporary times, promoting a spirit of ecumenism. Throughout its proceedings, the council produced sixteen documents, including four constitutions, nine decrees, and three declarations, covering a wide range of theological and pastoral issues. Notable among these are the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Lumen Gentium), the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum), and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et Spes).

The council saw a significant increase in the participation of bishops from around the world, reflecting the universal nature of the church. Observers from other Christian denominations were also invited, marking a step toward Christian unity.

The decrees and declarations of the council were promulgated by Pope Paul VI and have since been incorporated into the life of the church, inspiring various reforms and new directions in liturgical practice, ecumenism, and the church's engagement with the world. These documents are published in collections such as Acta Synodalia Sacrosancti Concilii Oecumenici Vaticani Secundi, ensuring that the council's teachings remain accessible for study and implementation.
