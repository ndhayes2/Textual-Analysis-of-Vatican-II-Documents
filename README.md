This is a private project for my own edification, and a learning experience. I hope to do an in-depth analysis of the texts of Vatican II, to better understand the Council and what it was attempting to achieve.

I hope to one day share this with others if it proves to be helpful for my own understanding.

Next steps: Continue local testing of functions to generate graphs for each document. Once testing proves these functions, upload to github and begin generating graphs for each document as such:
First, generate data/graphs for each document by parts (intro, chapter, section, etc.)
Then, generate data/graphs for the full document (Dei Verbum, Sacrosanctum, etc.)
Finally, generate one giant data set and graph for the entire council.
