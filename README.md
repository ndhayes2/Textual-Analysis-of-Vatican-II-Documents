This is a private project for my own edification, and a learning experience. I hope to do an in-depth analysis of the texts of Vatican II, to better understand the Council and what it was attempting to achieve.

So far, I have generated datasets (in .csv format) and graphs tracking parenthetical citations of Scripture for each document of Vatican II like the following:
![Dei Verbum Full Text Bar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cda9a0f9-b316-4b5a-9102-1d4cc03bec35)
![Presbyterorum_Ordinis_Pie](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58ce2a7-94b4-4703-8c0b-19b223ebc2d4)

Major findings:
The documents of Vatican II use parenthetical citations a total of 410 times. Of those 410 citations, an astounding 395 of them come from the New Testament. Here is the distribution of references, broken down by Old and New Testaments.

Of the 395 New Testament references, the Gospel of John is cited the most at 55 citations, followed by the Gospel of Matthew and the Epistle to the Romans at 44, and Acts of the Apostles at 37.

Of the 15 Old Testament references, the Book of Genesis is referenced 8 times, and the Psalms are referenced 4.

The large discrepancy in citation distribution makes sense; as the Church is no longer under the Old Testament, it is fitting that She should use the New Testament texts more frequently while not neglecting the Old.

Next steps: scan the appendices of each document for quotes by saints (especially St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Anselm, and other Doctors). Curate the documents such that allusions to the Scriptures are accounted for (such as references to Abraham, Moses, and David). Finally, deploy the findings to a website for others to reference and learn from.
